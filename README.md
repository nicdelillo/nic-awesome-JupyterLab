## I am looking for:
Please ping me if you find one of these extensions around the globe:
- A code hider that allows to show only results and markdowns. There is one not working on the latest jupyterlab version
[jlab-hide-code ](https://github.com/AixViPMaP/jlab-hide-code).


## Tip for setting JupyterLab with conda
Install JupyterLab in your `my-env` conda environment ([doc](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)). The idea is to run JupyterLab from your `my-env` and install python kernels from different environments, for example `my-other-env`. So that you have to install extensions only in one environment `my-env` to keep JupyterLab always up to date,

To install kernels from a different environment, install `ipykernel` ([doc](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html)) in each environment you want to use.
Supposing `my-env` is where your JupyterLab is, and `my-other-env` is the environment containing the kernel you want to access:

    $ conda activate my-other-env
    (my-other-env)$ conda install ipykernel
    (my-other-env)$ ipython kernel install --user --name=my-other-env --display-name="<any_name_for_kernel>" 

Where `--name` refers to the environment, while `--display-name` is the name will be displayed in the JupyterLab launcher for this kernel. If you do not pass that option, environment name will be used.
You should see a message sounding like: 

    Installed kernelspec my-other-env in User/Library/Jupyter/kernels/<any_name_for_kernel>

Now open JupyterLab from `my-env` to check if you can see the new kernel.

    (my-other-env)$ conda deactivate
    $ conda activate my-env
    (my-env)$ jupyter lab
    
NOTE: an equivalent way to install a kernel is:

    (my-other-env)$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my-other-env --display-name="<any_name_for_kernel>"
